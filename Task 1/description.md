Marble Game
This repository contains an implementation of a two-player game involving piles of marbles. The game can be played in two modes: standard and Misère. The objective and scoring mechanisms vary between these modes, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay.

Features
Game Modes:

Standard Mode: Players take turns removing marbles from the piles. The player who removes the last marble wins, and their score is based on the color and number of marbles removed in the final move.
Misère Mode: Similar to the standard mode, but the player who removes the last marble loses. This adds a twist to the usual gameplay and requires careful planning to avoid taking the last marble.
Marble Colors:

Each pile can contain red and blue marbles. Players can choose to remove marbles of a single color in each turn.
Scoring:

Standard Mode:
Red Marbles: 2 points per marble.
Blue Marbles: 3 points per marble.
Misère Mode:
The winner is determined by the player who forces the other to take the last marble. The score is based on the marbles removed in the last move but does not affect the outcome.
Human vs. AI:

Players can choose to play against another human or the computer. The AI makes moves based on a simple strategy to minimize the player's score.
Interactive Console:

The game is played through a console interface, providing prompts for player input and displaying the current state of the game.
